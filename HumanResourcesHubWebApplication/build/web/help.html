            This is a website designed for Human Resource Managers  for the Employees. It has all the details of of the 
            managers <br>
            who exists in the site. If the manager enters the incorrect login details, he/she will be denied to login. <br> 
            We have designed the system in such a way that only the managers with the correct login details, are 
            allowed access. <br>
            <br>
            If there's a new manager in the system, he/she will be given an opportunity to register and become part of  
            the web app. <br>
            It is required and very much important that the managers never forget their login details and thus advised to 
            write <br>
            them down.
            <br> 
            After all the managers who exist in the system have logedIn, they are taken to the Dashboard. <br>
            They will be warmly greeted and given the below options of what they'll like to do today. <br>
